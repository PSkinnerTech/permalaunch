# PR: Optimize Balance Check Command

## Current Implementation Analysis
The balance check command needs to:
- Focus solely on financial verification
- Integrate with new architecture
- Avoid overlapping with wallet checks

## Objectives
1. Streamline balance verification process
2. Implement cost estimation features
3. Enhance funding guidance
4. Follow new architecture patterns

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Refactor balance checks to use shared utilities
- [ ] Update balance check flow:
  - [ ] Verify DEPLOY_KEY exists (use validation.ts)
  - [ ] Get WINC balance
  - [ ] Get AR balance
  - [ ] Calculate deployment cost
  - [ ] Compare balance vs cost
- [ ] Add detailed cost breakdown
- [ ] Improve funding guidance

## Testing Plan
- [ ] Test balance retrieval
  - [ ] Test with sufficient balance
  - [ ] Test with insufficient balance
  - [ ] Test with zero balance
- [ ] Test cost estimation
  - [ ] Test with different build sizes
  - [ ] Test with various content types
  - [ ] Test with edge cases
- [ ] Test error scenarios
  - [ ] Network errors
  - [ ] API failures
  - [ ] Invalid responses

## User Experience
- [ ] Clear balance display
- [ ] Detailed cost breakdown
- [ ] Actionable funding guidance
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Error recovery steps

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update command help text
- [ ] Add cost estimation examples
- [ ] Document balance requirements
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Integration Points
- [ ] Use shared validation utilities
- [ ] Implement new architecture patterns
- [ ] Follow established command flow
- [ ] Maintain clear boundaries with other commands
