# Important context for understanding the codebase
context: |
  This CLI tool manages deployment keys for a blockchain application.
  Key features:
  - Automated wallet file detection and processing
  - Secure environment variable management
  - Base64 encoding of wallet data
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix)
  
  Security considerations:
  - Wallet files contain sensitive private keys
  - Environment variables must be properly secured
  - File permissions must be properly set
  
  Testing requirements:
  - All file operations must be tested
  - Error cases must be handled gracefully
  - Cross-platform compatibility must be verified
